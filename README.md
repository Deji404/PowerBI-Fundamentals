# PowerBI-Fundamentals

## Tools Used: PowerBI

### Description
This is part of the requirements for completion of the PowerBI Fundamentals course, which I took as part of the Business Intelligence and Data Analyst (BIDA) certification offered by the Corporate Finance Institute in conjunction with alX.

In this course, I used PowerBI and its inbuilt tools to build three dashboards from a fictional company’s sales data, provided as a csv file. The completed files are provided in a .pbix format.

This course explored:
• Data normalization
 
• Automating transformation of complex CSV files using Power Query

• Slice your analysis by any time period

• Essential DAX formulas such as CALCULATE and FILTER.

• Variable creation in PowerBI

• DAX time-intelligence

• Dashboard sharing.
